#not-the-weather
##this isn't the weather.

It's exactly the opposite, in fact.

You know those days when you're stuck ill-prepared for the elements? When you forget your umbrella, or when you have to lug around your jacket because it's too damn hot? when there's not a real problem, just the first world discomfort of getting wet or sweaty?

`<not-the-weather></not-the-weather>` was built to create those situations. It's a simple [Riot.js](www.riotjs.com) tag that queries the [openweathermap.org](http://api.openweathermap.org/) API and returns weather thats opposite the current conditions.

I made this mostly to play around with Riot. Or maybe I made this to prank someone. Or maybe both.
